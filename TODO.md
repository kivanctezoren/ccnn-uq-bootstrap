* Implement CCNN model, preferably in its own class
  * Run original [CCNN code](https://github.com/zhangyuc/CCNN/blob/849ff27fb63bd71dc3895fb51023e6fa005ec2a8/src/mnist/CCNN.py#L349) 
  * Implement numpy features with PyTorch
* Implement bootstrapping method using CCNN
* Implement training utilizing bootstrapping
  * Also implement the option to use transfer learning for CCNNs with >2 layers
    * Implement the option to use transfer learning methods proposed in paper
    * Add the novelties from UQ-Bootstrap paper
* Fill in README when there is enough information & the structure of project is defined
